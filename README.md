# convert_ts
Generic Timestamp Converter

## Usage

* Without any additional option it converts the first column from format `%d/%m/%Y:%H.%M.%S` to seconds since epoch and prints the rest of columns as the original output.
* Default input is stdin. Use -i to set a filename.
* Default output is stdout. Use -o to set a filename.
* If there are more timestamp columns, use -t to specify them.
* If the timestamp can have multiple formats, use -f to specify a list of them between double quotes.
* Keep in mind that these options affect the performance.
* The default separator is the semicolon. For changing it, use the option -s.
* If you want to exclude lines based on the timestamp, use --start and --end to specify the interval (in seconds since epoch).
* If there are multiple timestamps columns, specify the main timestamp using the option --main_ts.
* In order to set which columns to exclude or include, use options --exclude and --include.
* For printing milliseconds since epoch instead of seconds, use --ms.

##Â Limitations

%z [is not available](https://bugs.python.org/issue17342
) for function `datetime.strptime` in Python 2.x :-( 
I plan to port this code to Python 3. I want to code it purely on Python in order to execute it with pypy.

# Benchmarks

## Considerations

Python 2.7.10 and Pypy 5.9.0 were used. 
Pypy used the following options: `--jit vec=1 --jit vec_all=1`.
Also used the following trick which oddly boosts speed by a lot. `os.environ['TZ'] = 'GMT'` For example, from 95.6Klines/s to 129Klines/s.

## Execution line of the benchmarks

*Change python with pypy or python3 accordingly* 

### Only one timestamp

```Bash
yes "2017/12/06 22:46:53;2017/12/06 22:46:53;2017/12/06 22:46:53;2017/12/06 22:46:53;2017/12/06 22:46:53" | python convert_ts.py -t 0 -f "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S" | pv -l | head -2000000 > /dev/null 
```

### 5 Timestamps

```Bash
yes "2017/12/06 22:46:53;2017/12/06 22:46:53;2017/12/06 22:46:53;2017/12/06 22:46:53;2017/12/06 22:46:53" | python convert_ts.py -t 0 1 2 3 4 -f "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S" | pv -l | head -2000000 > /dev/null 
```
